This Online Banking System project is developed using Java Servlet, JSP, and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable code structure. The system enables users to manage their bank accounts online with secure and user-friendly features.

Features:
User Registration and Login: Secure authentication for new and existing users.
Account Management: View account balance, transaction history, and profile details.
Fund Transfers: Perform intra-bank and inter-bank fund transfers.
Transaction History: Track transaction details with date-wise filtering.
Admin Module: Manage user accounts and monitor transactions.

Technology Stack:

Backend: Java Servlet for processing requests and responses.
Frontend: JSP (Java Server Pages) for the dynamic content generation.
Database: MySQL (or any relational database) for storing user and transaction data.
Architecture: Follows the MVC design pattern for a clear separation of the business logic, UI, and control flow.

Project Structure:
Model (M): Represents the data (user accounts, transactions) and business logic of the system.
View (V): JSP pages are used to display the data to the user.
Controller (C): Servlets act as controllers, handling requests and routing them to the appropriate model or view.
